            // version. The only thing preventing that case from happening is the lack of a build target for any other
            // platform. This is somewhat ugly, since somebody adding a target needs to remember to go in and update all
            // availability checks, but there is no other option, since for some reason availability checks will always
            // treat unknown platforms as satisfying the constraint. It is not possible to work around this by using
            // `#unavailable`, since that always yields the inverse result of `#available`, even though the
            // documentation is unclear on this. This behavior makes it fundamentally impossible to distinguish between
            // systems that satisfy the constraint and systems that simply didn't exist at the time the constraint was
            // written, which is *never* useful and *always* the exact opposite of what is intended. It is ridiculous!
            // I don't know who thought this was a good idea. I don't understand how we got to this place. I don't
            // understand why no-one else seems bothered by this. Is everyone mad? Am I mad? I don't know. I hope to
            // find out some day.
