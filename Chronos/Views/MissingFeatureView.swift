                         Ok, there is good news and bad news.  The bad news is, there is absolutely nothing you can \
                         do or see here.  Whatever you came to try just isn't finished yet.  The good news is, that \
                         there is nothing you need to do either.  We are already working on this and it will be ready \
                         for you soon-ish.

                         So sit back.  Relax.  Get comfortable.  Have a drink.  And enjoy the feeling of having \
                         someone else do all the hard work for you.  Or not.  I won't tell you how to live your life.
